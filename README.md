#  The ninth task in Mechanical Engineering Path

## Introduction
The design idea is an easy-to-navigate paint room for the robot. I did not design wheels to facilitate transportation because the room must be stable during the painting process 

## The mechanism 
I used the rack and pinion mechanism for the door, it's one of the most famous mechanisms in the world and is used in steering cars with some electricity or oils to help drivers control.

## The windows
I suggest placing two windows on each side for a better view of the painting process

## The Fans
Fans must be installed to draw air out of the room and regulate room temperature
